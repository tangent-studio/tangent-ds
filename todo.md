- fix LDA

DONE
- scikit-learn's-like API across the whole pakcage, ml, mvs and plot
- fix logistic regression
- fix kmeans
- test Python similarity
- implement KNN, decision trees, random forest and generalized additive models (both in classification and regression)
- implement python tests and examples for KNN, decision trees, random forest and generalized additive models
- fix PCA, implement SVD
- review train, validation, preprocessing, tunig and interpret
- review plot, one ordiplot module for ordinations (PCA, LDA, RDA), add plot for feature importance, add ROC curves, add other ploting facilitators you might think useful...
